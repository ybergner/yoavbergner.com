My research combines psychometrics and learning sciences (especially design-based research) in pursuit of analysis methods that inform educational design. I am particularly interested in the assessment of learning in Makerspaces and Fablabs, in data literacy curriculum design with dancers, and in collaborative problem solving. 

Prior to joining the faculty at NYU, I was a research scientist at (the) Educational Testing Service. My post-doctoral path involved five years as a sculptor and a furniture-maker, followed by three years as a teacher in a public early college high school, where I taught science, mathematics, industrial arts, and philosophy of science.
