Yoav's research combines psychometrics and learning sciences in pursuit of analysis methods that inform educational design. He is particularly interested in the assessment of learning in Makerspaces and Fablabs, in data literacy curriculum design (with dancers!), and in collaborative problem solving. He co-developed CPSX, an extension for real-time small-group discussion using the Open edX learning management system. 

Prior to joining the faculty at NYU, Yoav was a Research Scientist at Educational Testing Service. His post-doctoral path involved five years as a sculptor and a furniture-maker, followed by three years as a teacher in a public early college high school, where he taught science, mathematics, industrial arts, and philosophy of science.
