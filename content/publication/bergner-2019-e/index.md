abstract: We report results of a design-research effort to develop a culturallyrelevant
  educational experience that can engage high school dancers in statistics and data
  science. In partnership with a local high school and members of its step team, we
  explore quantitative analysis of both visual and acoustic data captured from student
  dance. We describe prototype visualizations and interactive applications for evaluating
  pose precision, tempo, and timbre. With educational goals in mind, we have constrained
  our design to using only interpretable features and simple, accessible algorithms.
