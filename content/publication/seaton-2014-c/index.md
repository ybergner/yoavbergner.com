abstract: Â© 2014 American Association of Physics Teachers. We investigate how elements
  of course structure (i.e., the frequency of assessments as well as the sequencing
  and weight of course resources) influence the usage patterns of electronic textbooks
  (e-texts) in introductory physics courses. Specifically, we analyze the access logs
  of courses at Michigan State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
  each of which deploy e-texts as primary or secondary texts in combination with different
  formative assessments (e.g., embedded reading questions) and different summative
  assessment (exam) schedules. As such studies are frequently marred by arguments
  over what constitutes a \"meaningful\" interaction with a particular page (usually
  judged by how long the page remains on the screen), we consider a set of different
  definitions of \"meaningful\" interactions. We find that course structure has a
  strong influence on how much of the e-texts students actually read, and when they
  do so. In particular, courses that deviate strongly from traditional structures,
  most notably by more frequent exams, show consistently high usage of the materials
  with far less \"cramming\" before exams.
