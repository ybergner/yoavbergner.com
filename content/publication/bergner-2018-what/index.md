abstract: The diversity of substantive expertise and analytical techniques spanned
  by learning analytics can be a challenge for understanding and interrogating methodological
  choices. But active pursuit of methodological clarity is essential to productive
  multivocality. This was the focus of the LAK '17 Methodology in Learning Analytics
  workshop from which the idea for this special section arose. Discussions were framed
  using a building metaphor of developing structurally sound bridges between disciplinary
  methods. Strong arguments are buttressed by supporting evidence and warrants but
  also engage with potential alternative explanations. Papers in this special section
  further the discussion and encompass a range of relevant approaches including sensitivity
  analysis, model evaluation, model fit, causal inference, and visualization as a
  methodology. All advance the case of structural integrity in this bridge discipline
  and highlight the importance of adequate descriptions of methodological considerations
  to aid our common understanding.
