abstract: We report on an exploratory effort to design an interest-based learning
  experience for high school (step) dancers to engage with concepts in mathematics
  and data science. We hypothesized that generating and analyzing data from their
  own dance movement, through motion and audio capture, would (a) enable learners
  to form analogies between off-line embodied experiences and new abstract concepts
  and (b) support motivation to learn due to perceived relevance and usefulness of
  data science to dance practice. Based on initial interviews to understand the specific
  needs and interests of the steppers, we developed some early prototypes for visual
  and acoustic analysis, concentrating on pose precision, tempo, and spectral characteristics
  (timbre) for. Teacher and student reactions to the tools demonstrated support for
  our hypotheses that off-line embodied cognition would help with new knowledge acquisition
  and that the perceived usefulness of data science would motivate learning. Several
  promising future directions remain to develop an interest-based and embodied data
  science curriculum.
