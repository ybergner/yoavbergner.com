abstract: The current generation ofMassiveOpenOnline Courses (MOOCs) operate under
  the assumption that good students will help poor students, thus alleviating the
  burden on instructors and Teaching Assistants (TAs) of having thousands of students
  to teach. In practice, this may not be the case. In this paper, we examine social
  network graphs drawn from forum interactions in a MOOC to identify natural student
  communities and characterize them based on student performance and stated preferences.
  We examine the community structure of the entire course, students only, and students
  minus low performers and hubs. The presence of these communities and the fact that
  they are homogeneous with respect to grade but not motivations has important implications
  for planning in MOOCs.
