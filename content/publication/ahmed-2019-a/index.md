abstract: 'Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. A key promise of adaptive collaborative
  learning support is the ability to improve learning outcomes by providing individual
  students with the help they need to collaborate more effectively. These systems
  have focused on a single platform. However, recent technology-supported collaborative
  learning platforms allow students to collaborate in different contexts: computer-supported
  classroom environments, network based online learning environments, or virtual learning
  environments with pedagogical agents. Our goal is to better understand how students
  participate in collaborative behaviors across platforms, focusing on a specific
  type of collaboration - help-giving. We conducted a classroom study (N = 20) to
  understand how students engage in help-giving across two platforms: an interactive
  digital learning environment and an online Q&A community. The results indicate that
  help-giving behavior across the two platforms is mostly influenced by the context
  rather than by individual differences. We discuss the implications of the results
  and suggest design recommendations for developing an adaptive collaborative learning
  support system that promotes learning and transfer.'
