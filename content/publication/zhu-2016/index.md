abstract: Â© 2016 ACM. This paper explores a longitudinal approach to combining engagement,
  performance and social connectivity data from a MOOC using the framework of exponential
  random graph models (ERGMs). The idea is to model the social network in the discussion
  forum in a given week not only using performance (assignment scores) and overall
  engagement (lecture and discussion views) covariates within that week, but also
  on the same person-level covariates from adjacent previous and subsequent weeks.
  We find that over all eight weekly sessions, the social networks constructed from
  the forum interactions are relatively sparse and lack the tendency for preferential
  attachment. By analyzing data from the second week, we also find that individuals
  with higher performance scores from current, previous, and future weeks tend to
  be more connected in the social network. Engagement with lectures had significant
  but sometimes puzzling effects on social connectivity. However, the relationships
  between social connectivity, performance, and engagement weakened over time, and
  results were not stable across weeks.
