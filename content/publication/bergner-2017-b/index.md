abstract: 'Psychological measurement is a process for making warranted claims about
  states of mind. As such, it typically comprises the following: de ning a construct;
  specifying a measurement model and (developing) a reliable instrument; analyzing
  and accounting for various sources of error (including operator error); and framing
  a valid argument for particular uses of the outcome. Measurement of latent variables
  is, after all, a noisy endeavor that can neverthe- less have high-stakes consequences
  for individuals and groups. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction
  to educational and psychological measurement for practitioners in learning analytics
  and educational data mining. It is organized thematically rather than historically,
  from more conceptual material about constructs, instruments, and sources of measurement
  error toward increasing technical detail about particular measurement models and
  their uses. Some of the philosophical differences between explanatory and predictive
  modelling are explored toward the end.'
