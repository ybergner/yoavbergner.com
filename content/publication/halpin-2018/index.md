abstract: The social combination theory of group problem solving is used to extend
  existing psychometric models to collaborative settings. A model for pairwise group
  work is proposed, the implications of the model for assessment design are considered,
  and its estimation is addressed. The results are illustrated with an empirical example
  in which dyads work together on a twelfth-grade level mathematics assessment. In
  conclusion, attention is given to avenues of research that seem most fruitful for
  advancing current initiatives concerning the assessment of collaboration, teamwork,
  and related constructs.
