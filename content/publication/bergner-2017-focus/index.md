abstract: The following paper gives an overview of the inaugural Methodologies in
  Learning Analytics Workshop at the International Learning Analytics & Knowledge
  Conference 2017 in Vancouver, Canada. The event discussed many topics but two key
  themes emerged, that of middle space, the space between learning and analytics in
  which methodologies reside and the importance of multivocality, the challenge of
  finding shared analytic objectives and learning to not talk past one another. The
  following summarizes these themes and their importance for generating robust methodological
  arguments within Learning Analytics.
