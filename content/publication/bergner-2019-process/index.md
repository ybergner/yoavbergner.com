abstract: This article reviews how National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)
  has come to collect and analyze data about cognitive and behavioral processes (process
  data) in the transition to digital assessment technologies over the past two decades.
  An ordered five-level structure is proposed for describing the uses of process data.
  The levels in this hierarchy range from ignoring the processes (i.e., counting only
  the outcomes), to incorporating process data as auxiliary or essential in addition
  to the outcome, to modeling the process as the outcome itself, either holistically
  in a rubric score or in a measurement model that accounts for sequential dependencies.
  Historical examples of these different uses are described as well as recent results
  using nontraditional analytical approaches. In the final section, speculative future
  directions incorporating state-of-the-art technologies and analysis methods are
  described with an eye toward hard-to-measure constructs such as higher order problem-solving
  and collaboration.
